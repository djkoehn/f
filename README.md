## Game Mechanics

- **Tokens**: Start with 3 tokens per round, press SPACE to spawn
- **Blocks**: Connect blocks to create token processing paths
  - Input Blocks (Green): Generate tokens with initial values
  - Operation Blocks (Blue/Purple): Modify token values
    - Add: Adds a fixed value
    - Multiply: Multiplies by a fixed value
  - Output Blocks (Red): Collect processed tokens for scoring

## Controls

- SPACE: Spawn token from random input block
- Left Click: Select and drag blocks
- Right Click: Return block to toolbar

## Benefits of Multi-Channel Processing (MCP)

- **Separation of Concerns**: Isolates functionalities for better organization.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces bottlenecks by processing channels independently.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new channels as the project grows.
- **Flexibility in Event Handling**: Prioritize events based on importance.
- **Easier Debugging and Testing**: Test channels independently for easier troubleshooting.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Create a more responsive and immersive gameplay experience.

## Modular Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following main components:
- **Audio**: Handles game audio and sound effects.
- **Config**: Configuration settings and constants.
- **Game**: Core game mechanics and logic.
- **UI**: User interface components.
