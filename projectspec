## Core Architecture

### Block System

#### Block Types
1. Interface Layer:
   - `IBlock`: Interface for blocks
     - Defines basic functionality such as socket access and token processing.

2. Block Hierarchy:
   - Stationary Blocks:
     - `Input`: Generates tokens; fixed position.
     - `Output`: Collects tokens; fixed position.
   - Dynamic Blocks:
     - `BaseBlock`: Base for all placeable blocks; inherits Node2D and implements IBlock.
       - Handles dragging, state management (InToolbar/Dragging/Placed/Connected), and token processing.
       - Uses JSON metadata (via BlockMetadata) to drive block-specific behavior.
     - Operation Blocks:
       - Operation behavior (e.g. Add) is now defined via JSON metadata and processed by BaseBlock.
       - This approach removes the need for separate block-specific classes.

#### Socket System
- Node2D-based socket architecture.
- Socket Types:
  - Input Socket ("BlockInputSocket")
  - Output Socket ("BlockOutputSocket")
- Socket Distribution:
  - Input blocks (IBlock): have output sockets.
  - Output blocks (IBlock): have input sockets.
  - BaseBlock derivatives: include both sockets.

### Connection System

#### Core Components
1. `ConnectionManager`: Manages active connections, maps blocks to pipes, and handles the Input->Block->Output flow.
2. `ConnectionPipe`: Visual representation of connections using Bezier curves and precise distance calculations.
3. `ConnectionFactory`: Creates standard connections, validates sockets and block compatibility.
4. `ConnectionValidator`: Checks bounds, compatibility, and rewiring constraints.

#### Connection Flow
1. Initial Setup:
   - Direct connection between stationary blocks.
2. Block Insertion:
   - Inserting a BaseBlock into an existing connection splits the connection into two segments.
3. Pipe Detection:
   - Uses curve-based hit detection with visual feedback.

### Game Management (`F.Game.Core`)

1. `GameManager`: Central game state management and block coordination.
2. `Inventory`: Manages block availability and metadata (using BlockMetadata).
3. `BlockInteractionManager`: Handles input, block selection, and drag operations.
4. `BlockFactory`: Instantiates blocks using metadata and configures them appropriately.

### UI System (`F.Game.Toolbar`)

1. Core Components:
   - `Toolbar`: Main toolbar container.
   - `ToolbarBlockContainer`: Manages block layout in the toolbar.
   - `ToolbarVisuals`: Visual components for the toolbar.
2. Block Management:
   - Blocks are created using the metadata-driven system and managed in the toolbar.
   - Dedicated helper classes (e.g. `ToolbarHelper`) assist with block repositioning.

### Utility Layer (`F.Utils.Helpers`)

1. Connection Utilities: `ConnectionHelper`, `PipeRewiringHelper`, and `PipeCurveCalculator`.
2. Input Handling: `InputHelper`, `DragHelper`, and `ToolbarHelper`.
3. Animation: `TweenHelper` and `ToolbarHoverAnimation`.

## Game Mechanics

### Token System
- 3 tokens per round.
- SPACE to spawn a token.
- Block operations modify token values.
- Output collects tokens for scoring.

### Controls
- SPACE: Spawn token.
- Left Click: Manipulate blocks.
- Right Click: Return block to toolbar.

### Block Operations
1. Input (Green, IBlock): Generates tokens.
2. Operation (Blue/Purple, BaseBlock): Dynamically alters token values (behavior defined via JSON metadata).
3. Output (Red, IBlock): Collects tokens for scoring.

## Configuration System

### Block Configuration
- `BlockMetadata.json`: Contains JSON metadata for block configurations (ScenePath, ProcessTokenScript, Name, Description).
- `BlockConfig`: Block-specific settings.
- `PipeConfig`: Connection pipe settings.
- `TokenConfig`: Token behavior settings.
- `ToolbarConfig`: UI component settings.
- `ZIndexConfig`: Manages visual layering.

## Audio System

### Sound Management
- `AudioManager`: Central audio control.
- `BlockSoundPlayer`: Plays block-specific sounds.
- `TokenSoundPlayer`: Plays token-related sounds.

## Multi-Channel Processing (MCP)

### Benefits
- Independent processing channels.
- Improved performance.
- Scalable architecture.
- Flexible event handling.
- Enhanced debugging.
- Responsive gameplay.

### Implementation
- Separate managers for different systems.
- Event-driven communication.
- State management per channel.
- Synchronized updates.
- Performance optimization
